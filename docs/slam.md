## General Terms and Concepts

### Submap Strucutres

Submap structures are smaller, localized sections of a more extended, or global map. They represent small sections of the original map. The intention behind using submaps is to break down the mapping process into smaller, more manageable subprocesses.

Submaps can be the following types:

- Grid-based Submaps
- Keyframe-based Submaps
- Region-based Submaps

### Covariance Strucutres

### Kdtree Strucutres

## Direct Lidar Odometry (DLO)
